## Project Introduction

    A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) suitable for small and medium-sized manufacturing industry, which integrates laboratory related data, sample tracking, analysis results, and instrument management functions to help laboratories improve work efficiency, data accuracy, and compliance.

- Sample management

    The LIMS system provides a powerful sample management module aimed at helping laboratories easily manage the receiving, tracking, and processing of samples. Whether it is a small-scale research project or a large laboratory, our sample management module can provide efficient, accurate, and traceable sample management solutions.
- Inspection records

    Provides a powerful inspection record module aimed at helping the laboratory effectively manage and record the data and results generated during the inspection process. The laboratory can digitize, standardize, and automate the testing process, improving data accuracy, efficiency, and traceability.

- Task allocation

    Provides an efficient and reliable inspection task module, aimed at helping laboratories manage and allocate inspection tasks, optimize workflow, and improve task execution efficiency. It can achieve centralized management, optimized allocation, and efficient execution of inspection tasks. Our solution aims to help laboratories improve work efficiency, reduce task scheduling conflicts, and ensure timely completion of tasks and result traceability.

- Equipment management

    Provides a powerful device management module aimed at helping the laboratory effectively manage and maintain various testing equipment, improve equipment utilization and work efficiency, and ensure the normal operation and continuous effectiveness of the equipment.

    The laboratory can achieve full lifecycle management, preventive maintenance, and troubleshooting of equipment. Our solution aims to help laboratories improve equipment utilization, extend equipment lifespan, and ensure equipment accuracy and reliability.

- Inventory management

    Our LIMS system provides an efficient inventory management module aimed at helping laboratories effectively manage and track inventory of laboratory consumables, reagents, samples, and other items, improving the accuracy and efficiency of inventory management. Laboratories can effectively manage and control inventory, reduce inventory waste and losses, improve material utilization and work efficiency.
